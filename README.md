# DT Frontend Task

This project was done as part of the **Frontend Intern assignment by DeepThought**.

## About the Task
The assignment had two parts.  
In the first part, I created the UI using **HTML and CSS** based on the given design.  
In the second part, I added **dynamic functionality using vanilla JavaScript**.

## What I Implemented
- Basic page structure with navbar and hero section
- Dynamic task cards rendered from JavaScript data
- Filter functionality based on task status
- A simple login popup for user interaction

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Run

### Run Locally
- Download or clone the repository
- Open `index.html` in a browser

### Live Demo

## My Approach
I started by building the basic layout and styling it using CSS.  
After that, I focused on the JavaScript part where I worked with JSON data and DOM manipulation to make the page dynamic.  
I also added small interactive features like filtering and a login popup to improve usability.
